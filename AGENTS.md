# Guidelines and Tips for Agents

This file is the first thing any agent (Claude, Codex, or other) should read when joining a session on this repo. It defines the runtime, the common tasks, the conventions, and the project-specific reminders. Keep it short and current.

## Startup Rule

At the beginning of a new chat or agent session for this project, read this file first and do not automatically read every markdown file in the repository. Use the [Documentation](#documentation) map below to decide which other files are relevant to the current task.

## Runtime Environment

When running code, tests, or the application for this repository, use a Python
environment with the pinned deps from `requirements.txt` (Dash 3 / Plotly 6 /
plotly-resampler 0.11 / dash-extensions 2 / pywebview). On the maintainer's
machine this is the shared conda env:

- conda env: `sleep_scoring_dash3.0`

Typical startup:

```
conda activate sleep_scoring_dash3.0
```

After activation, use that environment for commands such as:

- test runner: `python -m pytest -q`
- app launch: `python run_desktop_app.py`
- import checks, one-off scripts, etc.

## Common Tasks

Short recipes for the things you'll usually do in a session. All commands assume the env above is active.

Run the app for manual testing (then click "Load demo data"):

```
python run_desktop_app.py
```

Run the test suite:

```
python -m pytest -q
```

Quick import/version check without opening a window:

```
python run_desktop_app.py --smoke
```

There is no separate slow/optional-dependency suite — `pytest -q` is the whole
thing. The interaction layer is browser JS (`ts_app/assets/*.js`) that the tests
do not exercise; verify those by running the app and driving the gesture, or by
hitting the Flask routes directly (see `work_log.md` for the test-client recipe).

Pre-flight checklist before committing:

- Test suite is green: `python -m pytest -q`
- Smoke check passes: `python run_desktop_app.py --smoke`
- A new entry has been prepended to `work_log.md` describing what was done (including model + version, effort/thinking mode, and token budget if available), intended profiling signal if any, and the verification commands that were actually run.

If the change touches active modules, confirm imports still work — the smoke tests in `tests/test_smoke.py` cover this.

## When To Update Treaty Docs

At the end of any substantive work session, update `work_log.md` unless the user explicitly asks not to document it, says it is off the book, or the exchange was clearly trivial.

A session is substantive when it includes any of:

- file edits
- meaningful validation, debugging, profiling, or artifact inspection
- a technical decision or reversal
- discovered evidence future agents should not have to rediscover
- branch, PR, release, deployment, or environment state changes
- unfinished follow-up that belongs in `next_steps.md`

No work-log entry is usually needed for casual Q&A, explanation-only exchanges with no lasting project state, or tiny one-off commands with no future coordination value.

Log experiments when they produce reusable evidence, a decision, or a warning for future agents, even if the code change is reverted. Skip pure scratch work when it has no future coordination value or the user wants it omitted.

When a session creates or changes future work, update `next_steps.md` in the same pass: add concrete follow-ups, remove completed items, and keep "Currently Hot" accurate.

## Branch Handoff Discipline

Before switching away from an experimental or feature branch, fully resolve the work on that branch. Confirm whether the branch contains all intended changes, whether those changes are committed, and whether the user expects them merged, pushed, or intentionally left parked.

Do not switch to the integration branch (`main`) or start new work on another branch while important experimental-branch changes are only local, unmerged, or unverified. If related work accidentally lands on the integration branch, move that work back onto the experimental branch first and retest the combined behavior there before updating the integration branch.

Useful checks before switching or merging (portable git commands; run in any shell):

```
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --left-right --cherry-pick main...HEAD
git merge-base --is-ancestor main HEAD
```

## Release / Tag Checklist

If this project cuts releases or pushes tags, treat any request that combines **commit + push + tag** — or "cut a release" / "publish version X" — as a release. A release requires a documentation gate that must clear *before* the tag is created or pushed, not after. (Delete this section if the project never tags releases.)

Before creating an annotated tag, verify and update every release artifact that exists in this repo:

- Version metadata bumped and consistent with the tag: `VERSION` in `ts_app/__init__.py`.
- Changelog / release notes updated, if the repo has one (none yet — add one if the project starts cutting releases).
- User-facing docs (`README.md`, setup / usage docs) updated when behavior changed.
- `work_log.md` updated with the implementation summary, the verification commands actually run, and the release / branch / tag state.
- Verification recorded — the pre-flight checks passed and are noted in the work log.
- Any dated artifact uses the verified local date, not an unverified model-context date (see the dated-entry rule under Documentation → `work_log.md`).

Only after every applicable item is done: create the tag and push. Then verify the pushed refs landed where you expect:

```
git ls-remote --tags origin
git ls-remote --heads origin main
```

If a ref is missing or points at the wrong commit after the push, fix it before treating the release as complete.

## Documentation

Read these documents only as needed. The map below names each file and when it's worth opening.

- `work_log.md` and `work_log_archive/`
  - Use when the task needs recent implementation history, experiment outcomes, or verification breadcrumbs.
  - The live `work_log.md` holds at most the 5 most recent unique calendar dates. Default to reading only the two most recent dated entries.
  - Find date anchors with ripgrep and read only the slice you need:
    `rg -n '^## [0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}' work_log.md`
  - When older context is needed, open the matching file under `work_log_archive/` by its date-range filename, or grep across both at once:
    `rg -n '^## [0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}' work_log.md work_log_archive/`
  - When prepending a dated entry, if today's calendar date already has a `## YYYY-MM-DD` header at the top, add a new `###` session subsection under it. Do not start a second `## YYYY-MM-DD` header for the same date.
  - When prepending a new date would push the live log past 5 unique calendar dates, move the oldest 5 dates as a chunk into a new file at `work_log_archive/work_log_<earliest>_to_<latest>.md`. The live file always holds at most 5 unique dates; each archive file always holds exactly 5.
  - Before writing any dated entry, verify the workstation / repo-local date (`date +%F` on macOS/Linux, `Get-Date -Format yyyy-MM-dd` on Windows) and use that. When the model-context date and the local environment disagree — which happens across a UTC midnight boundary — trust the local date. Never write a future-dated entry. `treaty validate` enforces this: it fails with `work-log-future-date` when any entry is dated after the local date.

- `next_steps.md`
  - Use when planning or continuing unfinished work from previous sessions.
  - The "Currently Hot" pointer at the top names the active threads — read it first to know what's in flight.
  - Remove items after they are completed. Add new planned follow-ups when they become concrete.

- `project_overview.md`
  - Use when onboarding to the codebase structure or when a task touches an unfamiliar area.
  - The "What Looks Active vs. Legacy" section is the single most important map before editing — many repos accumulate parallel implementations, and this section keeps an agent from editing the wrong file.

- `README.md`
  - Use when changing user-facing setup, packaging, usage, or input-file expectations.

- Treaty badge (in your README)
  - `treaty init` offers (opt-in) a centrally-hosted "Agent Collab Treaty - adopted" badge. It is a pure visibility signal that links back to this treaty repository. No asset files are added to your project, and the image updates automatically if the design improves later. The badge is fully optional. The tri-color SVG (Codex blue / Claude amber / Grok dark) is the primary recommendation — its text is outlined to vector paths, so it renders identically on GitHub across every platform. The single-color shields.io variant is a fallback only for READMEs that also render outside GitHub (e.g. PyPI/npm), where raw SVG may be blocked.

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (if present)
  - Use when changing collaboration workflow, branch/test expectations, or documentation conventions.

The same anchor-grep pattern works for any structured Markdown doc in the repo — `grep -n '^## ' <file>` for the section map, then a targeted slice read rather than loading the whole file.

## Git Ownership Note

If Git reports a "detected dubious ownership" warning for this repo, mark this repository as safe.

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
git config --global --add safe.directory C:/path/to/this/repo
```

macOS / Linux:

```bash
git config --global --add safe.directory "$HOME/path/to/this/repo"
```

This is the preferred fix unless the repository ownership itself needs to be changed at the OS level.

## Pre-commit Note

If your stack uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) and it cannot write to its default cache location, set a repo-local cache before running it.

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
$env:PRE_COMMIT_HOME = "C:\path\to\this\repo\.pre-commit-cache"
python -m pre_commit run --all-files
```

macOS / Linux:

```bash
export PRE_COMMIT_HOME="$PWD/.pre-commit-cache"
python -m pre_commit run --all-files
```

Adjust the formatter / linter invocation for your stack (e.g., `npx lint-staged`, `cargo fmt`, `gofmt -l .`).

## Commit Message Guidelines

Commit messages should use:

- a short title line
- a short body with flat bullet points for additional requested changes when a commit contains multiple user-requested updates

Commit message bullets should describe high-level added or changed behavior, not implementation details.

For feature commits, mention only the user-facing behavior that was added or changed.

Do not mention tests, docs, project memory updates, or behind-the-scenes implementation details in a feature commit message unless that internal work is itself the main purpose of the commit.

## Project-Specific Reminders

These are the things that aren't obvious from reading the code and that an agent would otherwise have to learn the hard way. `COOKBOOK.md` explains all of them in depth.

- The shared x-axis id and overlay trace indices are **not** hardcoded. `ts_app/figure.py` publishes them in `figure.layout.meta` (`sharedXAxisKey`, `overlayTraceIndices`, `xBounds`, `numClass`, `frameRate`), and every `ts_app/assets/*.js` reads from there — so a different channel count needs no JS edits. If you rename a meta key, update every asset reader.
- The annotation overlay is a heatmap and needs a **2-D `z`** (`(1, N)`, never `(N,)`).
- Unscored labels are `-1` on disk and `NaN` (transparent) in display. The filesystem cache turns `NaN` into `None` on round-trip — comparisons use `equal_nan=True` and `== None` (see `ts_app/labels.py`, `app.py`).
- Custom pointer pan and annotation auto-pan must keep the relayout coalescer suppressed while active (`window.tsAppCustomPointerPan.isActive`, `window.tsAppAnnotationAutoPanActive`) or navigation relayouts fight each other.
- Native file dialogs return different types on Windows (tuple) vs macOS (string-like `objc.pyobjc_unicode`); `ts_app/dialogs.py` normalizes both — don't simplify it.
- To plug in a real data format, replace **only** `load_recording` in `ts_app/data.py`. Everything downstream consumes the domain-neutral recording dict documented at the top of that file.
- The fast-navigation path (`ENABLE_DIRECT_PLOTLY_RESTYLE` in `config.py`) uses `Plotly.restyle` directly and a raw Flask route `/_ts_app/resample`; the coalescer + `profileId` machinery keeps it from firing per animation frame.
